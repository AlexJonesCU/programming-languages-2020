# Project

Presentations will take place in the last week before the finals.

Groups of 4 students work well in my experience.

Choose a programming language (not Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, ... unless you want to dig into an interesting not widely known feature of these languages).

Let me know via [email using this link](mailto:akurz@chapman.edu?subject=CPSC-354-Presentations) by the end of the second week your groups and choice of programming language.

### Assessment

The assessment is split in 3 parts: presentation, blog, and code/documentation. Each part is worth 5% of the total grade.

- The presentation itself will be assessed on content, structure, supporting material such as slides and delivery.

- The blog will be assessed on how it addresses questions such as 
    - why you chose the programming language
    - history of the programming language
    - for what kinds of tasks the language is particularly suitable
    - examples of where it is used successfully
    - why I should consider the language to implement which task
    - some features you found particularly interesting
    - fun facts and anecdotes

- The code together with its documentation will be assessed on how well it answers to the following questions. 
    - Does the coding project make a user want to try the language? 
    - Is the documentation detailed enough so that the user can follow it? 
    - Does the project highlight some of the features that make the language particularly useful?
    - Will the coding project be a good starting point to learning the language?

### Presentations

Each group will get 5 min per student for the presentation (and each student should present for 5 min). 

### Blog, Code, Docomentation

Ideally, in addition to answering the questions above, the blog would also document your learning progress. Write a blog post every week. 

Code/documentation can be integrated into the blog and I recommend to host them on GitHub.

### Details on presenting the presentation

Don't run over time, but do make good use of the time allocated to you. 

On the day of the presentation we will can not afford to take more than a few seconds time for switching between presentations. 

We should not waste time for connecting your laptops for example.

I will login on my account on the PC in the room we will do the presentation. I think we should avoid loosing time for switching accounts, so best is if you can access your presentation on the web.
You can then use the browser on the PC to navigate there and present from the browser.
