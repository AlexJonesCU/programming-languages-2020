## Assignments

Here are the basic rules for assignments, let me know if there are any questions:

- You can work on the assignments in groups of two students.
- Each group makes a **private github** repository which is used for **all** assignments submitted by the group. Create subfolders of the repo such as `Assignment1`, etc (as appropriate).
- Sharing code for assignments is **plagiarism**. So be careful that your repo is indeed private.
- All students of the group as well as myself should be collaborators on the group repo.
- If you are stuck on your work, commit and push what you have to git and ask me a question. I can then inspect your code on git and give you quick feedback.
- Commit and push regularly. Typically, **you would commit and push after having implemented and tested a new function**. You need to create a trail of your work. It is not enough to only submit complete solutions. I need to be able to see the progress you are making over time. As git has version control, do not create different files/folders for the different versions of the same source code file. I can always go back and look at the history to see what you have done. Use meaningful commit-messages.
- To collaborate on the same file, consider using branches (eg one for each student). Do not make copies of the same file: Branches allow collaborators to work on the same file independently. Branches can then be merged later again. 

Anything unclear? Any questions? Let me know ...

#### List of Assignments

[Assignment 1](assignment-1.md) (9%): Functional Programming: First Steps in Haskell. Part 1 handed out Sept 15 (Part 2 to follow on Sept 17), hand-in Sept 28 (midnight, via github, but send me an email as well). I recommend to do Part 1 in the first week and Part 2 in the second week. 

Assignment 2 (9%): Interpreter of a functional programming language

Assignment 3 (9%): Interpreter of an imperative programming language
