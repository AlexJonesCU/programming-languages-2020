# programming-languages-2020

This course has been developed by Alexander Kurz and Samuel Balco and will be taught by Alexander Kurz.

The course is divided in a practical and theoretical component. 

Students will learn how to

- build a parser and interpreter for simple functional and imperative programming languages. 

as well as the fundamental ideas of

- operational and denotational semantics    
- term rewriting   
- invariants and well-founded orders     
- program verification and Hoare logic    
- structural inductions, universal algebra, category theory    

On the way, students will encounter different programming languages such as Dafny and Haskell, theorem provers such as Isabelle, dependently typed programming languages such as Idris as well as programming concepts such as algebraic data types, recursion, variable binding, polymorphism, and more.

Assessment is divided accordingly in programming assignments, presentations, and written examinations, currently planned as follows.

- Assignment 1: Recursive programming over lists and trees in LambdaNat. (10%)   
- Assignment 2: Installing the Haskell Platform. (5%)   
- Assignment 3: Writing an interpreter for LambdaNat. (10%)    
- Assignment 4: Programming with pointers in LambdaFun. (10%)   
- Assignment 5: Writing an interpreter for LambdaFun. (10%)   
- Test 1: Term rewriting. (5%)   
- Test 2: Program verification. (5%)   
- Presentation on a programming language of your choice. (15%)   
- Final Exam. (30%)
