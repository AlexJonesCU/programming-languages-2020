- if you have not done so already, 

  - install the Haskell platform
  
  - clone this repository 

        git clone https://github.com/alexhkurz/programming-languages-2019.git

- cd into this directory

- generate a parser as described [here](https://github.com/alexhkurz/programming-languages-2020/blob/master/Lab1-Lambda-Calculus/README.md)

- build an interpreter with `stack build` 

- choose or write a `mypgrogram.lc` in the folder `test`

- run `stack exec LambdaNat-exe test/myprogram.lc`
