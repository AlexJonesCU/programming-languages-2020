# Blog/Tutorial on Haskell      

Learning a new programming language is always a challenge, in particular if it is the first functional programming language you are going to learn.

You only know that you understand something if you can explain it to somebody else.

The minimal way to set up a blog is as follows:

- Create a public github repository.
- Add a `README.md`.
- Make `.md` files for each blog entry. Link them from the README.

To learn markdown, google "markdown cheat sheet" ... it is easy.

There are currently no fixed deadlines. The expectation is that you write the blog like a diary, as you go on in the course. Write it with beginning Haskeller's in mind. 

**Drop me an email when you made a new entry.**

Here are some things I would like to learn from you:
- How do newcomers learn functinal programming?
- Which external sources (videos, blogs, tutorials, etc) do you find most useful?
- How does Haskell compare to your favourite programming language? Give examples of the same algorithm written in your favourite language and in Haskell. What are the respectives strengths and weaknesses of the two programming paradigms?
- What are, in your opinion, the major stumbling blocks in learning Haskell?
- What are projects you may want to explore in Haskell?
